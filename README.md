## How to do something

Create an `[example]` shortcut. 

The following arguments are available, all but the first argument are optional:

`Style` = example style, unused in this extension

**TODO:** *Change the heading to match your extension. Describe what the user can do with your extension. Most of the time you can describe everything in one section. However if your extension has lot of functionality you can also break it down into multiple sections.*

## Examples

Embedding an example text:

    [example]
    [example abc]
    [example abc 123]

**TODO:** *Show how your extension can be used. Give multiple examples that can be copy/pasted.*

## Settings

The following settings can be configured in file `system/settings/system.ini`:

`ExampleSomething` = example setting, unused in this extension  
`ExampleStyle` = example style, unused in this extension  

**TODO:** *Show how your extension can be configured. Describe settings and files that the user can adjust.*

## Installation

[Download extension](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-example/archive/master.zip) and copy zip file into your `system/extensions` folder. Right click if you use Safari.

**TODO:** *Change the link to your own repository. Mention third party libraries and web services that you use.*

## Developer

Example Name. [Get help](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extension-example/issues).

**TODO:** *Add your name. Change the link to your own repository or website. Review the documentation from the perspective of the user.
